I submit these widgets to the Perl community in the hope that someone
other than myself will find them useful. I have placed POD documentation
within as many as I could, time permitting, and those that do not have
adequate documentation will do eventually. The example programs should
show adequate usage profiles, though.

Requirements :-

    Tk::TiedListbox - by Andrew Allen <ada@fc.hp.com>
    Tk::Pane - by Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>

The suite is built/installed in the conventional manner :-

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The public classes are :-


	Tk:CheckBox -   A radio button style widget that uses a
                    check mark in a box. Useful as a boolean field.

	Tk:Columns	-   A multicolumn list widget with resizeable borders
                    and sorting by column.

	Tk:ComboEntry - A Drop down listbox + entry widget with nice keyboard
                    equivalent behaviour

	Tk:IconCanvas - A canvas implementing a moveable iconic interface.
                    Allows attaching menus to icons and to background.

	Tk:SplitFrame - A sliding separator for two child widgets. Allows either
                    horizontal or vertical separation between the two widgets.
                    Can work in concert as horizontal inside vertical or
                    vice-versa.

	Tk:TabFrame   - A tabbed frame geometry manager (like NoteBook).

    # I consider the following widgets ready for use but having    #
    # behaviour that I would personally like to rewrite. I believe #
    # them to be relatively bug-free and invite you to try them out#
    ################################################################

	Tk::TabbedForm - An extended TabFrame, allowing managed subwidgets used
                     as entry fields. Each field widget is given a 'set'
                     and a 'get' method to provide widget independent
                     methods of maintaining and querying data. The form
				     will pass back a hash of all field values on request.

	Tk::TableEdit  - A compound widget built from the TabbedForm, SplitFrame,
                     and Column widgets. It implements a simplified interface
                     to a flat file database. Try out the demo.

	Tk::Menustrip  - My own menu bar. Nothing special, though.

The private classes are :-

	Tk:ChildNotification - A kludge that some of the widgets use to get
                           alerted when a child widget is created. It
                           reimplements a method in Widget.pm and Derived.pm.
                           This will work in TK8.0 but hopefully something
                           will be implemented to take its place.

Bugs, suggestions, fixes, etc. can either be sent to ptk@lists.stanford.edu
or directly to myself at dkw@rcm.bm. All critiques are welcome.
